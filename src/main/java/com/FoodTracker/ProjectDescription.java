	 *Food often goes to waste in our fridges, and this application is designed
	 * to help mitigate that occurrence. In addition to being a searchable log 
	 * that keeps track of what is in the fridge, pantry, and freezer at any 
	 * given time, this application will also provide reminders to the user when 
	 * food is close to expiring. Another feature is grocery list generation, 
	 * which the app will generate for the user at regular intervals, comprised 
	 * of all the food that was used since the last generation, can have items 
	 * added manually, as well as having the option to remove all expired items 
	 * from the storage locations and add them to the grocery list. This 
	 * application will use persistent memory so as to be useful after closing 
	 * the program. Any food can be removed or added Favorite foods will be kept 
	 * track of based on frequency of addition. This program will be command 
	 * line driven.
